## Dockest constructor

### Reference usage

```ts
import { Dockest } from 'dockest'

const { run } = new Dockest({ opts })
```

### opts

| Prop            | Required | Type     | Default                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| afterSetupSleep | false    | number   | 0                                       | Additional sleep after initial setup. Useful when services require additional time to boot and there's no applicable healthcheck                                                                            |

| composeOpts     | false    | object   | see next [paragraph](#opts.composeOpts) | Options to forward to `docker-compose <composeOpts> up`                                                                                                                                                     |
| debug           | false    | boolean  | false                                   | Pauses Dockest just before executing Jest. Useful for more rapid development using Jest manually                                                                                                            |
| dumpErrors      | false    | boolean  | false                                   | Serializes errors and dumps them in `dockest-error.json`. Useful for debugging.                                                                                                                             |
| exitHandler     | false    | function | null                                    | Callback that will run before exit. Received one argument of type { type: string, code?: number, signal?: any, error?: Error, reason?: any, p?: any }                                                       |
| jestLib         | false    | object   | require('jest')                         | The Jest library itself, typically passed as { lib: require('jest') }. If omitted, Dockest will attempt to require Jest from your application's dependencies. If absent, Dockest will use it's own version. |
| jestOpts        | false    | object   | {}                                      | Jest's CLI options, an exhaustive list of CLI-options can be found in [Jest's](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html) documentation                                                                            |
| logLevel        | false    | object   | logLevel.NORMAL                         | Decides how much logging will occur. Each level represents a number ranging from 0-4                                                                                                                        |
| runInBand       | false    | boolean  | true                                    | Initializes and runs the Runners in sequence. Disabling this could increase performance                                                                                                                     |

_Note: Jest runs tests in parallel per default, which is why Dockest defaults `runInBand` to `true`. This will cause jest to run sequentially in order to avoid race conditions for I/O operations. This may lead to longer runtimes._

| dependents   | false    | DockestService[] | []      | Functions that generate commands to determine the service's health. E.g. responsiveness checking a database using `select 1`.
